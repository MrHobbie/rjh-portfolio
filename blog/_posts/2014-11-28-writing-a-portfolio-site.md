## Writing a Portfolio Website

#### Things I have learned that might help you

***

Portfolio's are much different than the traditional resume or CV. I would expect the online portfolio to become something that all professionals will need as a way of combining your social and business life together. The social world of Facebook and Twitter have become part of your everyday life which includes the working hours. Prospective employers, contract or otherwise, want to understand who they are hiring. Start thinking about your online presence and a portfolio site.

I have been involved in software development for most of my career, but always from a business perspective and usually in a managerial capacity. In this world a resume is all that is required. Your accomplishments are most likely company confidential and as such not presentable on a public portfolio site.

>... getting started as a freelance web developer ...

I anticipated getting started as a freelance web developer was going to take some time and required getting the necessary bits in place to showcase my experience, albiet limited at this time. In addition my programming knowledge required a refresher.  All of this was exactly what I wanted to do and was up for the challenge. I was about to start down a path I knew was right for me.

After spending a number of weeks upgrading my skills on Lynda.com and other tutorial websites, I was ready to see what I could do.

My first attempt turned out a business style PowerPoint presentation. I was still in that mode and needed to get more personal, lighten up but still be professional.

>The nuggets found on this site, I now needed to personalize for a web developer just starting out.

After a couple more attempts, there were a number of changes, primarily in functionality with the content remaining much the same. In researching portfolio sites, I came across a blog by [Barry Clark](http://barryclark.co). Barry writes about web development and how to get hired. Barry critiques portfolio sites and provides excellent feedback. I find his site to be particularly useful in determining what content goes into a portfolio. The nuggets found on this site, I now needed to personalize for a web developer just starting out.

One thing that really stood out for me, was the need for design capabilities. I realized that I didn't have an eye for design even though I certainly knew what I liked or didn't like. I decided to purchase a UI kit, which is similar to hiring a UI designer. More on that in a related post.

Having a pre-built website is a great start, but you still need to make it your own and of course, fill it with your content. Having read a number of portfolio sites, I had a good idea of what was included. The result is now what is [posted](http://jchobsononline.ca). I am really pleased with how it has all turned out. Patience and determination are key.

There were a number of challenges in writing a portfolio website, but the biggest one, was getting my head in the game. Yes, the technology is new, but not a great deal different than other programming tools I have used. With experience comes knowledge, but also the knowing there is still so much to learn. The journey continues ....
